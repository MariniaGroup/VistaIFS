        <p>2.1 VistaIFS requires payment in advance before any services begin.</p>
        <p>2.2 We will not begin work until the first month’s subscription payment is successfully received.</p>

        <h2>3. Billing Method & Autopay Requirement</h2>
        <p>3.1 VistaIFS bills monthly subscriptions in advance of each service month.</p>

        <h2>5. Renewals</h2>

        <h2>6. Failed Payments & Grace Period</h2>
        <p>6.1 If any monthly charge fails, you will have a 3-day grace period to update your payment method.</p>
        <p>6.2 If payment is not resolved within 3 days, services will pause automatically.</p>

        <p>7.1 You may cancel your subscription at any time with written notice (email is acceptable).</p>
        <p>7.2 Cancellations stop future invoices only.</p>
        <p>7.3 There are no refunds for the current billing cycle after payment is processed.</p>

        <h2>8. No Refunds Once Billing Cycle Begins</h2>
        <p>8.1 VistaIFS does not issue refunds for any billing cycle once services for that month have begun.</p>
        <p>8.2 All subscription fees are prepaid and final for the current month of service.</p>

        <h2>9. Scope of Work & Client Dependencies</h2>
        <p>9.1 VistaIFS’ ability to complete work depends on receiving required documents, access, and information from the client.</p>
