  <!-- COMPARISON -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why We Don’t Offer $149 Bookkeeping</h2>
    <p>
      Many low-fee providers are limited to basic data entry. Vista IFS is structured more like a
      boutique CPA firm, focused on clean files and audit-ready books.
    </p>

    <table class="simple-table">
      <tr><th>Feature</th><th>$149 Services</th><th>Vista IFS</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Accrual Accounting</td><td>❌</td><td>✔</td></tr>
      <tr><td>A/R and A/P management</td><td>❌</td><td>✔</td></tr>

  <!-- QUICKBOOKS SUBSCRIPTION NOTE -->
  <section>
      <h2>QuickBooks Online & Payroll Requirements</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    Vista IFS provides bookkeeping and payroll services on top of your own accounting software subscription.
    We do not resell or mark up QuickBooks; all QuickBooks subscriptions are billed directly by Intuit.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>QuickBooks Online is required</strong> for ongoing bookkeeping services. You may sign up
      directly with Intuit at
      <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        quickbooks.intuit.com/pricing
      </a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you choose to add <strong>Payroll administration</strong>, Intuit may also require a separate
      <strong>QuickBooks Payroll</strong> subscription. Those fees are billed by Intuit and are
      <strong>separate from VistaIFS bookkeeping and payroll administration fees</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clients who want to explore bundled QuickBooks Online + Payroll options can review Intuit’s
      current bundle offers here:
      <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/oa/payroll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        QuickBooks Online + Payroll bundles
      </a>.
      (Offers, trials, and promotions are controlled by Intuit and may change over time.)
    </li>
    <li>
      VistaIFS can assist you with choosing an appropriate QuickBooks plan, but
      <strong>subscriptions are always in your company’s name</strong>, and you remain responsible for
      all Intuit software charges.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- HOW PAYMENTS WORK -->
  <section>
    <h2>How Payments Work</h2>
    <p>
      Vista IFS uses a prepaid monthly subscription model. Services are billed in advance of the
      month of work.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We invoice through <strong>QuickBooks Payments</strong> (primary) and may use
        <strong>Stripe</strong> as a backup option if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        After onboarding, you’ll receive a <strong>secure payment link</strong> where you can enter
        your card or ACH details. Vista IFS never stores your full bank or card numbers on our own servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monthly subscriptions are set to <strong>automatic payment</strong> on your Billing Date,
        consistent with our <a href="refund-policy.html">Subscription Billing &amp; Refund Policy</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- SECURE ONBOARDING NOTE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Secure Onboarding &amp; Document Upload</h2>
    <p>
      All onboarding documents are uploaded through our <strong>secure online portal</strong>
      (no emailing sensitive files). After you complete the
      <a href="onboarding/index.html">Client Onboarding</a> intake, you’ll receive links to download,
      sign, and securely upload your engagement paperwork and supporting documents.
